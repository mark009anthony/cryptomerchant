        <p class="question">          
         <strong> What is Cryptomerchants? </strong>
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
          Cryptomerchants is an Australia-based company which intends to revolutionize the online payments system - one transaction at a time. Our company wants to provide a platform for a faster and safer way to send and/or receive money, make an online payment, or create a merchant account. Consider our services as an alternative to conventional payment methods such as checks and money orders.

         <p class="question">          
         <strong> How to open an account with Cryptomerchants? </strong>
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
          You will need to provide your name, address, contact number, email address, and financial information when you open an account with Cryptomerchants. We also ask that you create a password for your account and activate the two-way factor authentication for security purposes. This will help us protect your account against any potential potential fraud. Once you sign up with us, you will receive a confirmation email. Click the link provided in the email to verify your account. Please take note we don’t require a minimum amount to maintain your account.

         <p class="question">          
         <strong> What are the fees for setting up an account? </strong>
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
          It’s on us! Cryptomerchants does not levy any charge when you open an account with us. Also, there’s no fee when you sending money within Australia to family and friends using your Cryptomerchants account. The same rule applies for receiving money from your loved ones in the country. However, when you use your credit or debit card, the fee is 2.5 percent in Australia and 3 percent outside the country, plus 0.30 AUD of the amount you send.
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
          There’s no fee when using your account to buy purchase products and services. But, if you receive money for products and services from another merchant, let’s say you sold an item in any online selling website, the fee for every transaction is 2 percent plus 0.30 AUD of the total amount received.
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
          For sending and/or receiving a payment to/from family and friends outside the country, the charge differs depending on the country where the payment is to be sent/received. Check our fees for complete details.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          A customer can withdraw money from his Cryptomerchants account for free. However, if you opt to receive a check, there’s an additional fee of 1 AUD.

        <p class="question">          
         <strong> Can I close my Cryptomerchants account? </strong>
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
          We hate to see you go, but you can close your Cryptomerchants account. Before closing your account, make sure to withdraw any money from your balance. To do so, go to ‘Settings’ tab in your profile page. Click ‘Account Options’ and then choose ‘Deactivate Account.’ Bear in mind you can’t terminate your account with us if there are any limitations, unresolved disputes, or a balance.

        </p>

          No. Once an Cryptomerchants account is closed, there’s no way to reopen that account. When an account is closed, we delete all your previous transactions.

        <p class="question">          
         <strong> How to view my Cryptomerchants balance? </strong>
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
          Click the Balance tab found in your Cryptomerchants page.

        <p class="question">          
         <strong> Can I cancel a payment I’ve already sent? </strong>
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
          As much as possible, we advise our clients to double check their transactions or the information provided before proceeding. Anyhow, only unclaimed payments can be cancelled on certain conditions: a payment transmitted to an email address is not associated with a Cryptomerchants account or to a recipient with an unverified email address. For completed payments, you can get in touch with the recipient of the payment to request a refund. Please take note that if ‘Cancel’ is not included in the menu/option, that means the payment has been claimed and cannot be cancelled.
        </p>

        <p class="question">          
         <strong> Can I ask for a refund? </strong>
        </p>

        <p class="answer">
          Cryptomerchants can process a request for refund except in the event a payment has been completed. This is done based on how the original payment was made. If you used a credit card, we credit your credit card. If you tap a funding source other than a credit card, we will credit the money to your account. If you use both a credit card and another funding source, a certain portion goes to your credit card, while the remainder goes to your Cryptomerchants account. Refunding a credit card usually takes up to thirty (30) working days.
        </p>

        <p class="question">          
         <strong> How to file a formal complaint? </strong>
        </p>

        <p class="answer" style="padding-bottom: 50px">
          To submit a formal complaint to Cryptomerchants, visit Complaints Center and then compose the message.
